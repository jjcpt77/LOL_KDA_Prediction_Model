# ADC KDA Linear Regression Model
This page follows the development and evaluation of a predictive model using linear regression to estimate Kill-Death-Assist (KDA) ratios specifically tailored for Attack Damage Carry (ADC) champions based on postgame data.

In this project, I used a comprehensive dataset on competitive League of Legends matches to create a predictive linear regression model. The specific focus of this model is to predict the KDA (Kill-Death-Assist) of Attack Damage Carries (ADCs). This involves analyzing patterns and insights from the data to train the model, shedding light on the factors influencing ADCs' performance in the professional gaming scene. An exploratory data analysis was performed on this dataset prior to the development of this model, and the analysis findings can be found [here](https://jjcpt77.github.io/competitive_lol_matches_analysis/).
