# ADC KDA Linear Regression Model

**Author:** Rebecca Wu

In this project, I used a comprehensive dataset on competitive League of Legends matches to create a predictive linear regression model. The specific focus of this model is to estimate Kill-Death-Assist (KDA) ratios specifically tailored for Attack Damage Carry (ADC) champions based on postgame data. This involves analyzing patterns and insights from the data to train the model, shedding light on the factors influencing ADCs' performance in the professional gaming scene. An exploratory data analysis was performed on this dataset prior to the development of this model, and the analysis findings can be found [here](https://jjcpt77.github.io/competitive_lol_matches_analysis/).
